# Overview
  Welcome to the Sales Store Report repository! This project contains a Power BI report designed to analyze and visualize sales data from a retail store. The report offers insights into sales trends, product 
  performance, inventory levels, and customer behavior, helping businesses make informed decisions to boost profitability.
  In this repository, I have shared the Power BI Dashboard, where you can explore the report and the data used to generate it. Additionally, other relevant content and resources have been included for reference.

# Features
  Sales Trends: Visualize sales performance over time to identify peak sales periods and trends. Easily track sales growth and dips on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
  Product Performance: Analyze which products are the top sellers and those with lower sales. Understand product demand and optimize stock accordingly.
  Revenue Breakdown: View detailed revenue reports by categories, regions, or channels (e.g., online vs. in-store sales).
